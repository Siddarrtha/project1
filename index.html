    <p>
        HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language.

        <b>Markup Language:</b>
HTML is not a programming language like Python or Java. Instead, it's a markup language that uses tags to annotate text and other content to tell a browser how to display it. 
 <b>Structure and Content:</b>
HTML defines the structure of a webpage by organizing content into different elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. <br>
 <b>Tags:</b>
HTML uses tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< >), to define elements. For example,is the opening tag for a paragraph, and  is the closing tag.<br>
<b>Web Browsers:</b>
Web browsers interpret HTML code to render web pages on the screen, displaying the content and structure as intended. <br>
<b>Beyond Content:</b>
While HTML focuses on structure and content, it often works in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to create dynamic and visually appealing websites.
